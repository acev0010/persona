**Changes to make**

structure the first pharagraph into questions (the current pharagraph answers a lot of important questions but they are all together in the same pharagraph)

creating equal access for everyone: consider adding bullet points

Understanding adaptive techniques, tools and technology: add images

Use templates in the examples
